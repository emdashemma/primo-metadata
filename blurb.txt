This record was digitized from the Offenbacher Mozart Collection at the University of Washington Libraries.

The Offenbacher Mozart Collection is a collection of standard play (78 rpm) and long play (LP) recordings of the vocal music (operatic arias and ensembles, concert arias, lieder, and sacred music) of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This extensive collection was donated to the University of Washington Libraries in 1978 by Dr. Eric Offenbacher. Since that time the Music Library Listening Center has added to this collection which now contains over 1500 recordings.
